### Python webscraper

#### Motivation for this mini-project
 
I needed a way to fetch price data for a list of exchange-traded funds.
 
#### About the code

A list of ETFs can be specified in the code, and their current prices will be fetched from Yahoo Finance. The output is a csv file containing ETF symbols and prices.

The code was tested in Python 3.7.6.
